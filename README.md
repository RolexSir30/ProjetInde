# React and Hyperledger Aries Project

This project demonstrates how to set up and use a React application alongside Hyperledger Aries and ACA-Py (Aries Cloud Agent Python).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v12.x or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v6.x or later) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (v1.x or later)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo

2. Install Project Dependencies
React

Navigate to the React project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

Using npm:

sh

cd react-app
npm install

Or using Yarn:

sh

cd react-app
yarn install

ACA-Py (Aries Cloud Agent Python)

Navigate to the ACA-Py directory and set up the Docker containers:

sh

cd aca-py
docker-compose up --build

This will start the ACA-Py containers and necessary services such as PostgreSQL.
Usage
Starting the Development Server
React

To start the React development server and run the application locally:

Using npm:

sh

cd react-app
npm start

Or using Yarn:

sh

cd react-app
yarn start

This will start the app and open it in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000.
ACA-Py

To start the ACA-Py agent, ensure the Docker containers are running:

sh

cd aca-py
docker-compose up

This will start the ACA-Py agent on http://localhost:8000.
Building for Production
React

To create a production build of the React application:

Using npm:

sh

cd react-app
npm run build

Or using Yarn:

sh

cd react-app
yarn build

This will create an optimized build in the react-app/build directory.
Running Tests
React

To run the tests for the React application:

Using npm:

sh

cd react-app
npm test

Or using Yarn:

sh

cd react-app
yarn test

Using ACA-Py

ACA-Py provides a REST API to interact with the agent. You can access the API documentation at http://localhost:8000/api/doc once the agent is running.

Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, please ensure:

    Node.js, npm/Yarn, Docker, and Docker Compose are correctly installed.
    All dependencies are installed correctly.
    The development servers are running without errors.
