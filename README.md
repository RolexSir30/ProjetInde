# Truffle Project with Ganache

This project demonstrates how to use [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) with [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache), a personal blockchain for Ethereum development you can use to deploy contracts, develop your applications, and run tests.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v12.x or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v6.x or later)
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) (v5.x or later)
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) (GUI or CLI)

## Installation

### 1. Install Truffle

If you haven't already installed Truffle, you can do so using npm:

```sh
npm install -g truffle

2. Install Ganache

You can download the Ganache GUI from here or install the CLI version:

sh

npm install -g ganache-cli


3. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

sh

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo

4. Install Project Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

sh

npm install

Usage
1. Start Ganache

Start Ganache GUI or run Ganache CLI:

sh

ganache-cli

By default, Ganache CLI runs on http://127.0.0.1:8545.
2. Configure Truffle

Ensure your truffle-config.js file is configured to connect to your local Ganache instance. Here's an example configuration:

javascript

module.exports = {
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",  // Localhost (default: none)
      port: 8545,         // Standard Ethereum port (default: none)
      network_id: "*",    // Any network (default: none)
    },
  },
  // Configure your compilers
  compilers: {
    solc: {
      version: "0.8.0",    // Fetch exact version from solc-bin (default: truffle's version)
    },
  },
};

3. Compile Smart Contracts

Compile your smart contracts using Truffle:

sh

truffle compile

4. Deploy Smart Contracts

Migrate your smart contracts to the Ganache blockchain:

sh

truffle migrate

5. Run Tests

Run the tests to ensure everything is working correctly:

sh

truffle test
